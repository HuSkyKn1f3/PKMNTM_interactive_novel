# Welcome to 1st Person PokemonTM! (tecnically: Interactive PokemonTM Novel!)
I wanted to make a mini PokemonTM game, but I still do not know enough to make it. So I tought that a mini Interactive Novel could be in the realm of my possibility and interesting as a project.
First Person Karel and the Joke Bot exercise are what inspired me.

You will be in the garden of your house, like at the beginning of the PokemonTM (I like to write TM :) ) games and from there there will be a little patch of grass (to go look for PKMNTM) and the house to go heal and to look at Pokedex in the computer.

Objective of the game will be to complete the Pokedex.

Have fun! :)
